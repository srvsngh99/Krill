# KrillLM Backlog

Deferred-but-tracked engineering items. Each entry is something we consciously chose
*not* to do in the PR that surfaced it, with enough context to pick it up later. This is
the in-repo companion to the owner's out-of-repo board
(`~/.claude/plans/krillm-pending-work.md`), scoped to code-level follow-ups.

## Extract a shared MoE `SwitchGLU` / `QuantizedSwitchedLinear` module

**Status:** deferred (owner decision, native-MoE workstream).

**Context.** The `gatherQuantizedMM`-based expert dispatch (a stacked
`[E, O, I_packed]` quantized switched-linear per projection + a SwitchGLU that runs the
decode/prefill sort path) is currently **copy-pasted per family**:

- `Qwen3QuantizedSwitchedLinear` / `Qwen3SwitchGLU` — `Sources/KLMCore/Qwen3MoEModel.swift`
- `Gemma4QuantizedSwitchedLinear` / `Gemma4SwitchGLU` — `Sources/KLMCore/Gemma4Model.swift`
- one copy per new MoE family added in the native-MoE workstream (Mixtral, Qwen2-MoE,
  OLMoE, DeepSeek).

The only real difference between copies is the activation (SiLU/SwiGLU vs Gemma's GeGLU)
and a couple of router details. The `(token, expert)` sort path is *already* shared
(`Sources/KLMCore/MoESortPath.swift`) — this item is about sharing the rest.

**Proposed work.** Factor out a single generic `MoESwitchGLU` + `QuantizedSwitchedLinear`
in a dedicated file, parameterized by an activation closure (and any small per-family
knobs), then refactor Qwen3 + Gemma4 + the four new families onto it. Each refactor must
be gated by a **bit-exact** logit/output comparison against the pre-refactor module
(these are shipped, perf-critical paths — Qwen3-MoE and Gemma 4 both beat Ollama, and the
#85/#87 gather+sort wins must not regress).

**Why deferred.** The native-MoE workstream prioritizes breadth (port the four remaining
sidecar families) over consolidation. Copy-paste keeps each family PR self-contained and
zero-risk to the shipped Qwen3/Gemma4 paths. Consolidate once all families have landed
and their numerics are pinned by parity tests.
